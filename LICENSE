Creative Commons Legal Code

CC0 1.0 Universal

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive copyright and/or other restricted rights in literary and artistic
works, and permit the authors thereof to enter into various contractual
arrangements and statutory licenses, and to enjoy a body of rights and
remedies that may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Apart from the very limited exception of "fair dealing" (or equivalent)
whereby an otherwise applicable copyright may be overridden or
superseded, or where the author or copyright owner expressly and
unambiguously renounces all of his or her rights, it is virtually impossible
for anyone to freely use, copy, modify, translate, distribute, or otherwise
make available to the public any copyrightable work without infringing
any of the exclusive rights conferred by the copyright owner's
unilateral exercise of such rights ("Unilateral Exercise").

The fact that an author or copyright owner has rights should not be
taken to indicate that he or she intends to always enforce those rights.
To the contrary, Creative Commons is of the view that it is important
for authors and copyright owners to have a mechanism whereby they
can elect to empower the public at large to freely use, copy, modify,
translate, distribute, or otherwise make available a copyrightable work
without infringing any of the exclusive rights conferred by the copyright
owner's Unilateral Exercise.

The creator of a work who makes the work available under CC0 1.0
Universal does so to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law
of copyright, including without limitation the rights to reproduce, to
prepare derivative works of, to distribute, to perform, and to publicly
display the work, and the right to make the work available to the public.

To the extent that any such rights may subsist, the creator of the work
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all rights in the work,
including without limitation the right to copy, distribute, display, and
perform the work, and to make available to the public the work, including
the right to create derivative works thereof, on terms that prohibit
imitation, alteration, or adaptation of the work, or the right to
commercial use.

The creator of the work makes the work available under CC0 1.0 Universal
on the condition that the work is not misrepresented or used in a way
that would imply endorsement by the creator.

The creator of the work dedicates the work to the public domain and
permits the public to use the work freely without restriction or
limitation.

To the extent that copyright and related rights in a work may subsist,
the creator of the work, to the fullest extent permitted by law, waives all
copyright and related rights that the creator may have in the work.
The creator of the work also waives any rights to use, copy, modify,
translate, distribute, or otherwise make available the work to the public.

The creator of the work does not intend to create any new rights or
obligations with respect to the work, other than those provided for by
applicable law.

NO WARRANTIES

THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
WHATSOEVER, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR TITLE. THE CREATOR OF THE WORK
MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY THAT THE WORK IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
ERRORS, OR VIRUSES, OR THAT THE WORK WILL BE FREE FROM INTERRUPTIONS
IN OPERATION OR INABILITY TO ACCESS THE WORK.

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE CREATOR OF THE WORK BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER
PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES,
ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK, EVEN IF THE CREATOR OF THE
WORK HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

This Statement of Purpose is for the convenience of the public. It is not
intended to be a legal agreement or to create any legally binding rights
or obligations.
